                I'm happy this didn't turn out to be your birthday letter because I have way more to say now than I did then. At some
                point through our relationship things took a turn. What started as a two people in New York bonding over behavioral
                psychology eventually turned into two people drawing endless boundaries just to tolerate one another. My goal for this
                letter is to address my faults through that process, and acknowledge the important things about you that make me crazy
                about you. To remind myself and you why I truly love you.
                <br>
                You use to tell me I'm patient but truthfully I'm not. I might not be easily irritated but I'm not patient. Patience
                and ones threshold there of only starts past the point of irritation. I have as little tolerance of things that
                irritate me as you do. And for that I owe you a massive apology. I'm sorry I might seem calm at times but when it
                counts get upset too quick. It's not important that I'm good at the things that don't matter to you as much. In the new
                year I hope to show you again that the person I fell in love with and the reasons I fell in with her have always been
                because of her sophistication, brilliance, beauty and capability to make me a better person.
                <br>
                Throughout the year I've learned about history, I've become a pescatarian, I've become more aware of how unaware I am
                to the world around me, I've learned too much about what triggers me emotionally and how to better manage them (still
                got plenty of work todo on that) ‚Äî and none of it would be possible if it weren't for this relationship.
                <br>
                Though the turning point in our relationship wasn't Tilly, I do want to address that, as I know you're reading this
                thinking to yourself I've heard all these nice words before...
                <br>
                You've always been better than Tilly, and I know that everything that happened was due to my own insecurities not my
                attractions. I left you because I didn't have the tools to make sense of my world with you. I've never been with anyone
                like you and my identity felt compromised. I'm not intimidated by you anymore, I just hope I get the ability to prove
                to you how much I really appreciate your perspective on the world and how much it effects me in positive ways. I hope
                that in the new year I could learn from my mistakes from last, start new and prove to you that the person you are is
                the person I fell in love with and though we hit a few bumps in the road thats always been true. Even now.
                <br>
                Thank you for coming into my life and filling it with so much I didn't have, you've left your mark, one of which can
                never be erased.
                <br>
                I love you ‚ù§Ô∏è
